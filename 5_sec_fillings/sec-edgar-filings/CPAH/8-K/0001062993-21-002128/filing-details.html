<p style="text-align: justify;">The information set forth in the Introductory Note and Items 3.03, 5.01, 5.02, and 5.03 of this report are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On February 22, 2021, stockholders of the Company approved the Merger and on March 1, 2021, Parent completed the acquisition of the Company through the Merger.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the effective time of the Merger (the "Effective Time"), each issued and outstanding share of the Company's common stock (each a "Company Share"), other than the shares held by the Company, Alianza or Merger Sub, was cancelled and converted into the right to receive $3.49 per share in cash, without interest (the "Merger Consideration") and net of withholding.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Each vested option to purchase Company Shares that was outstanding as of the Effective Time was cancelled in exchange for the right to receive the excess of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price of such option, less any withholding. Each unvested option to purchase Company Shares or option with an exercise price greater than the Merger Consideration was cancelled. Each deferred share unit that was outstanding as of the Effective Time was cancelled in exchange for the right to receive the amount of the Merger Consideration less any withholding.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The aggregate Merger Consideration was approximately $25.6 million.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The foregoing summary does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the full text of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, which is incorporated by reference to Exhibit 2.1 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on December 7, 2020.</p>

In addition, the Company requested that Nasdaq file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") a notification on Form 25 to report the delisting of the Company Shares from Nasdaq and to deregister the Company Shares under Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act").</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Following the effectiveness of the Form 25, the Company intends to file with the SEC a Form 15 requesting the termination of registration of the Company Shares under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act and the suspension of reporting obligations under Section 13(a) and 15(d) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company Shares. Once such measures become effective, the Company will no longer be required to prepare and file public reports and will cease to file reports with the SEC.</p>
